- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeisianeSM
- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in technology
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Git and github at Santander Bank's Backend Bootcamp with Java. It was an opportunity that arose and I signed up. I had no idea I would get a scholarship.
I'm also learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the Front-end with Gustavo Guanabara.
